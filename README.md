Intro
---------------------
Securechain wallet is an update to the official Securecoin core wallet with critical fixes to potential security problems.
Securecoin is a free open source peer-to-peer electronic cash system that is
completely decentralized, without the need for a central server or trusted
parties.  Users hold the crypto keys to their own money and transact directly
with each other, with the help of a P2P network to check for double-spending. It is secured by six different algorithms and its CPU only mining is another security strength. 


Setup
---------------------
You need the Qt5 run-time and probably boost libraries to run Securechain Wallet. On Debian or Ubuntu:
	`sudo apt-get install libqt5gui5`

This initial release supports only Windows and Linux compilation. The MAC compatible codes will be released later.
